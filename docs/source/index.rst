Slate Quantum Documentation
===================

**SLATE** is a Python package designed to simplify 
the representation and manipulation of sparse or compressed matrices through a hierarchical,
modular system. By providing composable primitives like diagonal, truncated, and COO (Coordinate List)
bases, SLATE allows for flexibility and automatic transformations between different matrix representations.

SLATE aims to be **versatile** and **structured**, making it ideal for users who need a flexible
environment to work with matrix and tensor computations without the constraints of optimization
or efficiency requirements.
